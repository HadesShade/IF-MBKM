# IF-MBKM

A website that facilitates students to make requests for "Program Merdeka Belajar â€“ Kampus Merdeka" (MKBM).
This website is not deployed in production. Made by me just for Junior Web Programmer Certification from BNSP.

1. Admin LTE 3 Template for Frontend.
2. Python3 Flask for Backend.
3. MySQL (MariaDB) as Database.

How To Run :
Change any configuration based on your environment. And then issue this command in the web directory:
flask run --host=<your-listen-ip-address>
